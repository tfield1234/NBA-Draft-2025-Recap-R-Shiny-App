Hello,

This repository holds all of the code and data used to create and run my NBA Draft 2025 Recap R Shiny App. 
Folder names align with the file paths written in the app.R script, and users can run the app locally using this repository's content, excluding my personal deployment folder.
The app can also be found at this link: https://tbf3.shinyapps.io/NBADraft2025Recap/
